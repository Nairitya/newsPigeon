#News App Project created using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Why
I created this Project to apply my theoretical learning of React Class Components and to understand them more deeply and practically. I'll be soon modifying this app to use function based components and learn React hooks more deeply. 

I can say that I now have better understanding of using React and I also learned things like React Router to render the components without the page being refreshed.
After making this project I can say REACT IS FUN!!
